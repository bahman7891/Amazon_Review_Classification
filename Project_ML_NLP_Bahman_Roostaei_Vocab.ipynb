Understanding the ratings that a given text indicates helps for businesses to ultimately be able to collect the most relevant and most helpful reviews to their products. \n",

    "The data are obtained from [here](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/). The data includes about more than a 1000 review text for products like DVD's and Books and Kitchen tools. The data have been mostly cleaned and processed into dictionary of bi-grams. We reprocess the data and convert it to token sets as well and analyze both the tokens and also the original format. \n",

Since this is a multiclass classification we group the ratings that are close to each other (4 and 5) and (1,2). Note that there is no rating 3 option (see below for the histogram of labels). We then use regressor models to be able to analyze the model by ROC curve."
